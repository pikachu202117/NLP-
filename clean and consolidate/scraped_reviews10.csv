The camera of the phone is pretty immersive even in portrait mode, you are going to click amazing picture. Just one thing it take 10 to 15 seconds to optimise the image. But after that the result are so satisfying, the design of the phone is amazing, but you have to use back cover otherwise the vegan leather got dirty in terms of performance.
