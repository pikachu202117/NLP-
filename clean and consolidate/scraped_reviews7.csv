3,Fair,I have a Realme 4G phone in which I used  the internet while sitting inside the house but now I bought this phone from Motorola G 45 5G and the internet does not work inside the house at all. I am sad with Motorola for this. The network itself crashes in the middle. Motorola has to fix this issue either by updating it or by some other means.,Navraj Chhetri,"Certified Buyer, Birpara Tea Garden",10 months ago,0,1,motorola-g45-5g-brilliant-blue-128-gb,,,,,,
