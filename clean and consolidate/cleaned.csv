2146,4.0,Delightful,Been using the Edge 60 Stylus for a Month now everything is as expected works just great except the battery life it needs 2 Charge per day. It's a really unique smartphone providing a little bit of everything so you don't feel left out. It's great for productive users with the stylus which is definitely not just a gimmick and actually works well. The haptics are great as well. Cameras are good. Overall a balanced smartphone.
