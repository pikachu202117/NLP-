3,Just okay,"After using it for about 13 days, I have come to the conclusion that the phone's design, battery and display are excellent. However, it would have been better if Moto had noticed that quite a bit of the display is covered by a black border. In some cases the mobile is noticing the lake problem, but the lake is noticeable whenever a high range wallpaper is set. Overall if one is looking for a budget phone then this will definitely be your best option.
